# @p-stream/providers

READ: Most sources marked with üî• or ü§ù are only avaliable on https://pstream.org

Because these scrapers are getting harder and harder to maintain, as they get patched. We need to close-source them. This is unfortunate, but it's the reality of the pirating scene. Sites that we scrape are blocking us, and we keep losing them. Fortunately, P-Stream has partnered with many people who offered their services on the site.
You are still free to self-host; several sources are still usable, with more open-source ones coming soon. If you have experience coding, this is a great oppurtunity to develop your own scrapers. 

package that holds all providers of P-Stream.
